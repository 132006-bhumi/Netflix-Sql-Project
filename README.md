This project is focused on analyzing Netflix's movies and TV shows using PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract insights from the dataset that can help understand trends in content distribution, ratings, genres, countries, and other important factors.
# 🔍 Project Summary
Netflix is one of the largest streaming platforms in the world, offering a wide variety of content across genres, countries, and formats. In this project, I’ve worked with a dataset containing detailed information about Netflix shows and movies to explore meaningful patterns and answer real business-related questions using SQL on a PostgreSQL database.
# 🎯 What This Project Covers
The purpose of this project is to:

• Explore how Netflix's content is divided between movies and TV shows.

• Find out which countries contribute the most to Netflix’s content.

• Identify commonly assigned ratings and their distribution.

• Look at which directors are most featured on the platform.

• Analyze yearly trends in content releases.

• Filter content by specific keywords, names, or categories.
# ❓ Key Questions Explored
During the analysis, I focused on answering these questions:
✦ How many total shows (Movies + TV Shows) are there?

✦ How many movies and TV shows are there separately?

✦ What are the top 10 countries with the most Netflix shows?

✦ Find the oldest show available on Netflix?

✦ Find the most recent show added to Netflix?

✦ List all shows directed by 'Rajkumar Hirani'.

✦ How many shows have a rating of 'TV-MA'?

✦ Find all the shows where 'Shah Rukh Khan' is in the casts.

✦ List the top 10 directors with the most shows.

✦ List the shows that belong to the 'Drama' category.

✦ Count of shows released each year.

✦ Find shows with no director mentioned.

✦ Find all shows that were added in September.

✦ Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix.
# 💡 Key Findings
• The platform hosts a larger number of movies compared to TV shows.

• The most common rating on the platform is TV-MA, which indicates mature audience content.

• The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are among the top contributors to Netflix’s content library.

• Directors like Rajkumar Hirani and others have multiple shows listed.

• Drama is one of the most common genres on Netflix.

• Some records in the dataset have missing director information.

• A significant number of titles were added to the platform in September over the years.

Filtering descriptions using keywords helped in identifying content themes and trends.
# 📌 Final Thoughts
This project helped me understand how structured query language (SQL) can be used to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset. It demonstrates how data analysis can uncover content trends, user engagement patterns, and business opportunities in the streaming world.
The project can be extended by integrating visual tools like Power BI or Tableau for dashboards, or by applying machine learning models to predict content popularity.
